# STM32F407VG Startup Code :rocket:

## Overview ℹ️
This repository contains the startup code (`startup_stm32f407xx.c`) for the STM32F407VG microcontroller. The startup code initializes the microcontroller and sets up the interrupt vector table.

## File Description 📄
The `startup_stm32f407xx.c` file initializes various sections of memory and sets up the interrupt vector table for the microcontroller.

## Functionality 🔧
- Initializes the data segment initializers from flash to SRAM.
- Initializes the .bss segment with zero.
- Calls the system initialization function.
- Calls the main function.

## Interrupt Vector Table 🚨
The interrupt vector table is set up to handle various interrupts and exceptions. Each interrupt or exception has its corresponding handler function defined.

## How to Use 🛠️
1. Include the `startup_stm32f407xx.c` file in your STM32F407VG project.
2. Configure the linker script to link the startup code appropriately.
