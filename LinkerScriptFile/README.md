# Linker Script for STM32F407VG

This repository contains the linker script `LinkerScript.ld` for the STM32F407VGTx device from the STM32F4 series.

## Description

The linker script defines the memory layout of the STM32F407VG microcontroller, specifying the memory regions for code, data, heap, and stack.

## Memory Layout

### Memories Definition
- **CCMRAM**: Core-Coupled Memory (64KB)
- **RAM**: Random Access Memory (128KB)
- **FLASH**: Flash Memory (1024KB)

### Sections
- **.isr_vector**: Contains the interrupt vector table, located in FLASH memory.
- **.text**: Contains the program code, located in FLASH memory.
- **.rodata**: Contains read-only data such as constants and strings, located in FLASH memory.
- **.data**: Contains initialized data, located in RAM memory.
- **.bss**: Contains uninitialized data, located in RAM memory.
- **._user_heap_stack**: Specifies the heap and stack size, ensuring sufficient RAM memory allocation.

## Memory Addresses
- **_estack**: Highest address of the user mode stack.
- **_Min_Heap_Size**: Required amount of heap.
- **_Min_Stack_Size**: Required amount of stack.

## Usage
1. Include the `LinkerScript.ld` file in your STM32F407VG project.
2. Configure your build toolchain to use this linker script for memory layout.
3. Build and flash your project onto the STM32F407VG device.
